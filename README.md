# category-redirects
Script that adds any page that is a redirect to Category:Redirects. Iterates through all namespaces. Cointains a function for adding a page to a category. The pages generated by API:Allredirects are checked against all pages already in Category:Redirects, so that only pages needing to be added are passed to addToCategory(). There is also a second check in addToCategory(), so the second API call can be omitted if performance becomes an issue.
## BATCH_SIZE
Number of pages to process per run. The MediaWiki API only returns a maximum of 500 results per response (for bot accounts or those with the apihighlimits right).
## FILE_NAME
Name/path of the file containing the last processed page. Defaults to the pywikibot directory.
